				<h2>Mechanics</h2>

				<p>We chose to use omni-wheels because this would eliminate our need to turn our chassis 90 degrees at every turn. We built the chassis out of ¼” plywood. This was a good choice. We designed it in Solidworks and laser-cut the parts. There were maybe 50-100 microns of play in the joints, but after we glued it up, this didn’t seem to be a problem.</p>
				<h2>Sensors</h2>
				<h3>How it worked</h3>
				<p>We chose to use 8 ultrasound sensors (HC-SR04). We built a custom circuit to gather sensor data, consisting of 8 op-amps, 8 capacitors, and 2 4-input nor-gates. The sensors were operated in two groups. Because if we sampled all 8 at once, there would be interference between the sensors and we might never get accurate data.
				<br />
				HC-SR04’s are cheap -- we got them for $1.12 each. The alternative would be some type of infrared sensors, which will give unpredictable values when their beam doesn’t bounce off of something. We decided to use 8 HC-SR04’s because this would give us enough info to be able to keep ourselves parallel to the walls

				The circuit drew more power than we expected. On the first test, we burned out the arduino’s built-in voltage regulator and had to add a beefier one so we could power everything.
				<br />
				We were forced to use an Arduino Mega in order to have 8 Analog to Digital Converters (ADC’s). Arduino Uno has only 6.
