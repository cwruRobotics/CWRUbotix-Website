			<p class="blog_title">Altium Designer Helps Case Western Reserve University Students Design Robots Destined for Mars</p>
			<div class="division"></div>
			<p class="blog_text">
				The student-run robotics club at Case Western Reserve University (CWRUbotix) is a venue for students to apply what they learn in class to real world design problems.  Every year we participate in a variety of competitions ranging from 6 pound combat bots to 80 kilogram Martian excavating rovers.
			</p>
			<p class="blog_text">
				<b>Electronics Design for Students</b><br>
				In an effort to provide greater challenges for our electrical engineering students in the club, we decided to pursue custom electronics for our NASA Robotic Mining Competition Robot (more about this competition can be found here).  The goal of the competition is to design and build a large regolith and ice excavating rover that will inspire NASA’s designs for future robots destined for Mars. Custom electronics would allow us to also cut down on electronics costs (high current motor controllers cost us around $200) and explore advanced sensing and diagnostic capabilities.
			</p>

				<b>Choosing an ECAD Solution</b><br>
				Getting started with custom electronics meant that we first needed to choose a software package for our schematic capture and PCB design.  As a student-run club often strapped for money, we would generally look around for free and/or community-run software that meets our needs.  However, we also wanted to provide our electrical engineers with design experiences similar to those they would find in industry, and the aforementioned software packages simply do not compare to industry-used EDA tools.  In addition, many of our students had never used a schematic capture or PCB design tool. This meant that the software needed to be easy to learn and manage and provide complete documentation.  Altium Designer was clearly the ECAD choice for us.
			</p>
			<p class="blog_text">
				<b>Our Experience</b><br>
				Last year we used Altium Designer to design battery monitoring modules and motor controllers.  Although we did not complete as many projects as we had hoped, we learned a lot about the strengths Altium Designer has to offer. 
			</p>
			<p class="blog_text">
				Firstly, databases are incredibly easy to manage.  For our organization, a centralized database was necessary, as we wanted to streamline access to components.  Altium’s Database Library integration with Excel really sped up this process, allowing us to quickly add new components and create many components in bulk.  This system allowed our database manager to easily accommodate component requests from multiple projects in a timely fashion.
			</p>
			<p class="blog_text">
				Altium Designer is also very easy to learn.  With a few lectures on the user interface and example projects, students (even those with no prior schematic or PCB experience) were able to work independently on projects throughout the design workflow.  Young electrical engineers should not be bound by ECAD software, and Altium Designer really facilitated student learning and understanding of electronics design.
			</p>
			<p class="blog_text">
				Altium Designer’s level of documentation is rarely seen in competing software packages, and we made full use of it throughout the learning and design process. We had answers to many of our questions within minutes.  This was especially useful as no one in the organization had extensive experience with the software.  
			</p>
			<p class="blog_text">
				Finally, Altium Designer integrates schematic capture and PCB design seamlessly.  Not only does this make Altium Designer more intuitive to use, the seamless integration allows for immediate design feedback on mechanical constraints, quick iteration of component choices, and a quicker development process entirely.  This was extremely useful to us as deadlines approached in the design process.
			</p>
			<p class="blog_text">
				<b>Thoughts on the Future</b><br>
				Now that our first year using Altium Designer is done, we plan to take what we learned and apply it to another round of custom electronics solutions.  Most importantly, now that we have a larger population of Altium users, we will be in a much better position to teach our younger members the awesomeness of circuit and PCB design.  On the to-do list for next year are smart brushless motor controllers, hardware based robot localization solutions, isolated power supplies, co-processor modules, and more.  The future is bright for electrical engineers in CWRUbotix, thanks to Altium!
