      <p>
        The <a href="http://www.thenrc.org/">National Robotcs Challenge</a> (NRC) is multiple robotics competitions rolled into one event. Held nearby in Marion, Ohio
        in the beginning of April, the competitions are open to students in 6th grade through graduate school. In 2016, our teams participated in the Rescue, Combat,
        Maze, and Sumo competitions.
      </p>
      <div class="nrc_team" id="nrc_rescue">
        <h2>Rescue</h2>
        <p>
          The rescue bot traverses complex terrain and uses a robotic arm to manipulate objects. The arena is set up to represent a disaster scenario, where robots are needed to go where humans can't. This competition is all about flexibility and manuverabiity.

      <div class="nrc_team" id="nrc_combat">
        <h2>Combat</h2>
        <p>
          Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Saws, rammers, grabbers, flippers, and weapons of all kinds are all allowed in robot combat.
          Competition classes range from 100 grams to 220 pounds.<br />
          The Fish, a 3-pounder, competed at NRC in 2016. It won the bronze medal and was
          the only combat nominee for the Honda Innovation Award. The Fish was built by Michael Schaffer, Hanyu Zhang, Johanna Fritzinger,
          Jonathan Mertz, George Hernandez, and Ailin Yu. It was laid to rest in the display cabinets on the third floor of Glennan.

      <div class="nrc_team" id="nrc_maze">
        <h2>Maze</h2>
        <p>
          This robot must use simple sensors, precise motors, and advanced algorithms to traverse a 3D maze. Our team won the silver medal at NRC 2016.

      <div class="nrc_team" id="nrc_sumo">
        <h2>Sumo</h2>
        <p>
          Like the maze robot, this one requires sensors and smart electronics. Unlike the maze, this competition puts two robots from different teams in the ring at once. The first one to leave the ring loses. Pushing power, and the ability to use it in a targeted way, is key.
