	      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
	      <p>
	         CWRUbotix creates robots that solve challenging and relevant problems. In pursuing this objective, it provides the student body with opportunities to learn concepts beyond their curriculum, to gain real world experience in leadership, project management, robotics and related fields, and to promote STEM and robotics education within the local community.
	      </p>

	      <h2>The Team</h2>
	      <p>
	        Our core team is composed of <X> students, self-selected with our open membership policy, who currently participate in our projects, events, and competitions. But we can't do it alone. We rely on community members, local professionals, alumni, businesses, and other students to support our mission through volunteering, mentorship, and sponsorship.
	      </p>
		  <p>
	        At the begining of each school year, our team designs and runs a robotics "bootcamp" to fulfill the first part of our mission: cultivating STEM skills and experience in our members, especially new members, who consistently make up a huge portion of our team. This 4-week program has students work in teams to design and build a robotic prototype that demonstrates their proposed solution to a chosen real-world problem. By demo day, all of our members are ready to take their skills to our compeitition projects and outreach events.
