      <p>
        The <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/centers/kennedy/technology/nasarmc.html">NASA Robotics Mining Competition</a> (NASA RMC) is a national
        collegete competition for which teams design a robot capable of excavating simulated Marsian regolith within a similuted Mars enviroment. The competition
        is held every year in May at the NASA Kennedy Space Center.

      <h2 class="project_title">National Robotics Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="http://www.thenrc.org/">National Robotcs Challenge</a> (NRC) is multiple robotics competitions rolled into one event. Held nearby in Marion, Ohio
        in the beginning of April, the competitions are open to students in 6th grade through graduate school. In 2016, our teams participated in the Rescue, Combat,
        Maze, and Sumo competitions.

        <h3>Combat</h3>
        <p>
					Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Saws, rammers, grabbers, flippers, and weapons of all kinds are all allowed in robot combat.
					Competition classes range from 100 grams to 220 pounds.<br />
					In April 2016, The Fish, a 3-pounder, competed at the National Robotics Challenge in Merion, OH. It won the bronze medal and was
					the only combat nominee for the Honda Innovation award. The Fish was built by Michael Schaffer, Hanyu Zhang, Johanna Fritzinger,
					Jonathan Mertz, George Hernandez, and Ailin Yu. It was laid to rest in the display cabinets on the third floor of Glennan.
